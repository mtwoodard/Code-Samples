fragment - WebGL.glsl
---------------------
Implementation of a various space raymarcher capable of local
honeycomb-like structures as well as true individual objects.
Also contains code for estimating normals and the signed distance
field for global objects. Meant to be pieced together with other parts 
in order to form a complete shader. Allowing for different shader 
possibilities which can be changed at runtime.

globalsInclude - WebGL.glsl
---------------------------
Variable declarations, function forward declarations, and some 
generic functions. Also an interactive implementation of the phong
model as well as tri-planar texture sampling. Meant to be pieced
together with other parts in order to form a complete shader. Allowing
for different shader possibilities which can be changed at runtime.
